# Photon_Research
Passed research done for the Anycubic photon. 
Some items are not available due to current/future research.
Some of the papers were for a college course, not written to be published, and a majority of the work was taken out. 
These files are more for reference than citation for future work with slicing and anti-aliasing.

---------------------------------------------------------------
The Photon Web Server is all open source and not close to being finished. These files are for people who want to create their own web server controller.

The current version uses UART 1 on the Original Photon board, UART6 and WIFI port are not connected software wise, currently(V4.2.18).  
This program is also using an ESP8266 from adafruit, other versions may not be 5v compatable.

--------------------------------------------------------------
BE CAUTIOUS WHEN WIRING THE BOARD!!
---------------------------------------------------------------
Alternative to ESP8266 is a Pi Zero W with an ethernet hat to connect to the ethernet port and UART 1. Using both allows for uploading
photon files and control. Possibly could do everything with one or the other but not tested.
